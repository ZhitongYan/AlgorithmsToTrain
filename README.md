## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Hi friend! Welcome to my algorithms blog! (It doesn't seem to be a "real" blog though. XD)

I'm Zhitong, an idealist, a dreamer, and a programmer. The reason why I finally open this little blog is that DP problems has always been the headache. Another reason is that I want to do something good to both me myself and others like me.

Talk is cheap, just begin the travel of algorithms :)
